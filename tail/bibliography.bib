  abstract = {Companies providing cloud-scale services have an increasing need to store and analyze massive data sets such as search logs and click streams. For cost and performance reasons, processing is typically done on large clusters of shared-nothing commodity machines. It is imperative to develop a programming model that hides the complexity of the underlying system but provides flexibility by allowing users to extend functionality to meet a variety of requirements. In this paper, we present a new declarative and extensible scripting language, {SCOPE} (Structured Computations Optimized for Parallel Execution), targeted for this type of massive data analysis. The language is designed for ease of use with no explicit parallelism, while being amenable to efficient parallel execution on large clusters. {SCOPE} borrows several features from {SQL.} Data is modeled as sets of rows composed of typed columns. The select statement is retained with inner joins, outer joins, and aggregation allowed. Users can easily define their own functions and implement their own versions of operators: extractors (parsing and constructing rows from a file), processors (row-wise processing), reducers (group-wise processing), and combiners (combining rows from two inputs). {SCOPE} supports nesting of expressions but also allows a computation to be specified as a series of steps, in a manner often preferred by programmers. We also describe how scripts are compiled into efficient, parallel execution plans and executed on large clusters.},

  abstract = {Good software engineering practice demands generalization and abstraction, whereas high performance demands specialization and concretization. These goals are at odds, and compilers can only rarely translate expressive high-level programs to modern hardware platforms in a way that makes best use of the available resources. Generative programming is a promising alternative to fully automatic translation. Instead of writing down the target program directly, developers write a program generator, which produces the target program as its output. The generator can be written in a high-level, generic style and can still produce efficient, specialized target programs. In practice, however, developing high-quality program generators requires a very large effort that is often hard to amortize. We present lightweight modular staging ({LMS)}, a generative programming approach that lowers this effort significantly. {LMS} seamlessly combines program generator logic with the generated code in a single program, using only types to distinguish the two stages of execution. Through extensive use of component technology, {LMS} makes a reusable and extensible compiler framework available at the library level, allowing programmers to tightly integrate domain-specific abstractions and optimizations into the generation process, with common generic optimizations provided by the framework. {LMS} is well suited to develop embedded domain-specific languages ({DSLs)} and has been used to develop powerful performance-oriented {DSLs} for demanding domains such as machine learning, with code generation for heterogeneous platforms including {GPUs.} {LMS} has also been used to generate {SQL} for embedded database queries and {JavaScript} for web applications.},

The authors derive formulae that show how to minimize the communication in the {SFR} algorithm, discuss its performance on a parallel database prototype, and evaluate its practicality under various conditions.

  abstract = {The {MapReduce} distributed programming framework has become popular, despite evidence that current implementations are inefficient, requiring far more hardware than a traditional relational databases to complete similar tasks. {MapReduce} jobs are amenable to many traditional database query optimizations ({B+Trees} for selections, column-store-style techniques for projections, etc), but existing systems do not apply them, substantially because free-form user code obscures the true data operation being performed. For example, a selection in {SQL} is easily detected, but a selection in a {MapReduce} program is embedded in Java code along with lots of other program logic. We could ask the programmer to provide explicit hints about the program's data semantics, but one of {MapReduce's} attractions is precisely that it does not ask the user for such information. This paper covers Manimal, which automatically analyzes {MapReduce} programs and applies appropriate data-aware optimizations, thereby requiring no additional help at all from the programmer. We show that Manimal successfully detects optimization opportunities across a range of data operations, and that it yields speedups of up to 1,121\% on previously-written {MapReduce} programs.},

  title = {Query optimization for massively parallel data processing},
  abstract = {{MapReduce} has been widely recognized as an efficient tool for large-scale data analysis. It achieves high performance by exploiting parallelism among processing nodes while providing a simple interface for upper-layer applications. Some vendors have enhanced their data warehouse systems by integrating {MapReduce} into the systems. However, existing {MapReduce-based} query processing systems, such as Hive, fall short of the query optimization and competency of conventional database systems. Given an {SQL} query, Hive translates the query into a set of {MapReduce} jobs sentence by sentence. This design assumes that the user can optimize his query before submitting it to the system. Unfortunately, manual query optimization is time consuming and difficult, even to an experienced database user or administrator. In this paper, we propose a query optimization scheme for {MapReduce-based} processing systems. Specifically, we embed into Hive a query optimizer which is designed to generate an efficient query plan based on our proposed cost model. Experiments carried out on our in-house cluster confirm the effectiveness of our query optimizer.},

  title = {Steno: automatic optimization of declarative queries},
  shorttitle = {Steno},
  abstract = {Declarative queries enable programmers to write data manipulation code without being aware of the underlying data structure implementation. By increasing the level of abstraction over imperative code, they improve program readability and, crucially, create opportunities for automatic parallelization and optimization. For example, the Language Integrated Query ({LINQ)} extensions to C\# allow the same declarative query to process in-memory collections, and datasets that are distributed across a compute cluster. However, our experiments show that the serial performance of declarative code is several times slower than the equivalent hand-optimized code, because it is implemented using run-time abstractions---such as iterators---that incur overhead due to virtual function calls and superfluous instructions. To address this problem, we have developed Steno, which uses a combination of novel and well-known techniques to generate code for declarative queries that is almost as efficient as hand-optimized code. Steno translates a declarative {LINQ} query into type-specialized, inlined and loop-based imperative code. It eliminates chains of iterators from query execution, and optimizes nested queries. We have implemented Steno for uniprocessor, multiprocessor and distributed computing platforms, and show that, for a real-world distributed job, it can almost double the speed of end-to-end execution.},

In this article, I show how expressive {DSLs} can be hygienically embedded in the Converge programming language using its compile-time meta-programming facility, the concept of {DSL} blocks, and specialised error reporting techniques. By making use of pre-existing facilities, and following a simple methodology, {DSL} implementation costs can be significantly reduced whilst leading to higher quality {DSL} implementations.},

The simplicity of the programming model and the quality of services provided by many implementations of {MapReduce} attract a lot of enthusiasm among distributed computing communities. From the years of experience in applying {MapReduce} to various scientific applications we identified a set of extensions to the programming model and improvements to its architecture that will expand the applicability of {MapReduce} to more classes of applications. In this paper, we present the programming model and the architecture of Twister an enhanced {MapReduce} runtime that supports iterative {MapReduce} computations efficiently. We also show performance comparisons of Twister with other similar runtimes such as Hadoop and {DryadLINQ} for large scale data parallel applications.},

These workloads typically process their entire dataset. {MapReduce} can be inefficient, however, when handling business-oriented workloads, especially when these workloads access only a subset of the data. {HadoopToSQL} seeks to improve {MapReduce} performance for the latter class of workloads by transforming {MapReduce} queries to use the indexing, aggregation and grouping features provided by {SQL} databases. It statically analyzes the computation performed by the {MapReduce} queries. The static analysis uses symbolic execution to derive preconditions and postconditions for the map and reduce functions. It then uses this information either to generate input restrictions, which avoid scanning the entire dataset, or to generate equivalent {SQL} queries, which take advantage of {SQL} grouping and aggregation features. We demonstrate the performance of {MapReduce} queries, when optimized by {HadoopToSQL}, by both single-node and cluster experiments. {HadoopToSQL} always improves performance over {MapReduce} and approximates that of hand-written {SQL.}},

Traits are a fundamental unit of code reuse. They are very similar to classes with two exceptions:

Traits can not have constructors
Super calls are dynamically bound

Unlike java interfaces which intrinsically make a tradeoff between client side usability and interface implementers amount of boilerplate. Traits brake this barrier by having method implementation and fields provided. Good example would be Ordered[T] which requires only one method to be implemented but provides many ordering methods ({\textgreater}=, {\textless}=, {\textless}, {\textgreater} etc.)
Dynamic super reference enables Stackable Modifications. Stacable Modifications are enabled by having traits that extend the abstract class and call the same method on super instance. The method in trait must be declared as abstract override. The order of stackable modifications is from left to right (the rightest  trait mixed in will be executed first).
Stackable modifications are the nice way to implement the wrapper pattern.
 
Multiple inheritance problems with Scala traits are resolved by linearizing types. {TODO}

The {LLVM} compiler framework and code representation together provide a combination of key capabilities that are important for practical, lifelong analysis and transformation of programs. To our knowledge, no existing compilation approach provides all these capabilities. We describe the design of the {LLVM} representation and compiler framework, and evaluate the design in three ways: (a) the size and effectiveness of the representation, including the type information it provides; (b) compiler performance for several interprocedural problems; and (c) illustrative examples of the benefits {LLVM} provides for several challenging compiler problems.},

   abstract    = {Deeply embedded domain-specific languages (EDSLs)
                 intrinsically compromise programmer experience for
                 improved program performance. Shallow EDSLs complement
                 them by trading program performance for good programmer
                 experience. We present Yin-Yang, a framework for DSL
                 embedding that uses Scala macros to reliably translate
                 shallow EDSL programs to the corresponding deep EDSL
                 programs. The translation allows program prototyping and
                 development in the user friendly shallow embedding, while
                 the corresponding deep embedding is used where
                 performance is important. The reliability of the
                 translation completely conceals the deep embedding from
                 the user. For the DSL author, Yin-Yang automatically
                 generates the deep DSL embeddings from their shallow
                 counterparts by reusing the core translation. This
                 obviates the need for code duplication and leads to
                 reliability by construction.},

  title = {Hadoop++: making a yellow elephant run like a cheetah (without it even noticing)},
  volume = {3},
  shorttitle = {Hadoop++},
  abstract = {{MapReduce} is a computing paradigm that has gained a lot of attention in recent years from industry and research. Unlike parallel {DBMSs}, {MapReduce} allows non-expert users to run complex analytical tasks over very large data sets on very large clusters and clouds. However, this comes at a price: {MapReduce} processes tasks in a scan-oriented fashion. Hence, the performance of Hadoop --- an open-source implementation of {MapReduce} --- often does not match the one of a well-configured parallel {DBMS.} In this paper we propose a new type of system named Hadoop++: it boosts task performance without changing the Hadoop framework at all (Hadoop does not even 'notice it'). To reach this goal, rather than changing a working system (Hadoop), we inject our technology at the right places through {UDFs} only and affect Hadoop from inside. This has three important consequences: First, Hadoop++ significantly outperforms Hadoop. Second, any future changes of Hadoop may directly be used with Hadoop++ without rewriting any glue code. Third, Hadoop++ does not need to change the Hadoop interface. Our experiments show the superiority of Hadoop++ over both Hadoop and {HadoopDB} for tasks related to indexing and join processing.},
